**Chess Game with Pygame**

This project is a 2D chess game created using Python and Pygame, focusing on basic game logic and graphical rendering. 

The game includes a functional chessboard, piece movement, and simple interaction, all built in an object-oriented manner.

**Features:**

Interactive Chessboard: Displays an 8x8 chessboard using Pygame graphics.

Piece Representation: Chess pieces are loaded as images (e.g., wp.png for white pawn) and rendered on the board.

Turn-based Gameplay: Alternates turns between white and black players.


**Modular Structure:**

ChessEngine.py: Contains game state management, including board setup and move tracking.

ChessMain.py: Handles user input, graphics rendering, and the main game loop.


**Technologies:**

Python: The primary programming language.

Pygame: Used for rendering the game interface and handling graphics.
